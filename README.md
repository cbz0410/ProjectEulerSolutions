Solutions to the first few PE problems

Note: I did, in fact, achieve top 1% using Java; however, all of my files were wiped off of my laptop after an incident at school and my solutions are now gone. Seeing that this would take a large amount of time to recreate all of my solutions again I have opted to not do so but attempt to solve the first 50 or so problems with different programming languages.
