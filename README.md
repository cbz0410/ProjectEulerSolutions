Solutions to the first few PE problems

Note: I did, in fact, achieve top 1% using Java (113 problems solved); however, all of my files were wiped off of my laptop after an incident at school and my solutions are now gone. Knowing that it would take a large amount of time to recreate all of my solutions again, I have instead opted to solve the first 50 or so problems with many different programming languages in order to expand my skill diversity as a programmer.

Currently working on >>> Python

Here is proof of my achievements:
